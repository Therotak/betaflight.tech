## Betaflight 3.3 Release will be ready for March 1st. ##

### New feature : Arming disabled while connected to Betaflight configurator ###

Arming is now disabled when the **flight controller is connected to the Betaflight configurator.**

This was added in order to keep users from accidentally arming their craft when testing their RX / mode switches with a battery connected.

In order to enable arming for bench testing, go to the 'Motors' tab and enable the 'Motor test mode' switch (REMOVE ALL PROPELLERS FIRST);
