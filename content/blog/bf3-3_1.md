## Betaflight 3.3 Release will be ready for March 1st. ##

### New feature : Runaway take off prevention (anti-taz) ###

This feature will prevent uncontrollable acceleration ('tasmanian devil') when the craft is armed with misconfigured motor outputs or props on the wrong way, by disarming the craft if such a configuration is detected.

It will also cause disarms when throttling up quickly on the bench with props off.

If you get unwanted disarms right after arming, use the parameters:

* runaway_takeoff_threshold
* runaway_takeoff_activate_delay
* runaway_takeoff_deactivate_delay
* runaway_takeoff_deactivate_throttle_percent

to tune the function to work for you, and **please report back your working configuration.**
