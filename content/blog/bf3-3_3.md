## Betaflight 3.3 Release will be ready for March 1st. ##

### New feature : support for the FrSky FPort protocol ###

**FPort** is a new RC protocol that was developed by FrSky in collaboration with Betaflight.

It has a number of improvements over existing protocols used by FrSky hardware:

>    only one serial connection is required, RC control information, telemetry (including MSP tunneling), and RSSI are all sent over this connection;
>    the serial connection uses 115200, N81, making it easier to implement on hardware that has limited support for 'exotic' modes;
>    it is **uninverted** (not possible with the test firmware for existing RX).

#### A driver for FPort has been added to Betaflight. It is available in nightly releases, and will be included in Betaflight 3.3. ####
