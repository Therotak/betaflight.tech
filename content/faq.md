Betaflight is a OpenSource Project to get the most of your Quadcopter or Plane. Enjoy FPV and have the latest features available on a whole variation of flightcontrolers.

## 1. Where to download the latest releases and also see the changelogs?

The [Downloads](/downloads/) entry menu can answer your question. Otherwise You can always find the latest releases on our [Github releases Page](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases). There you can also see the latest changelogs.

## 2. Which flightcontrollers are Betaflight compatible ?

You will find a complete and up to date list in the flash section of the Betaflight configurator. Otherwise you can see the list on the [Github Release page](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases).

## 3. Where can I find tutos or documents about Betaflight flash and use ?

Reading the [wiki pages](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/wiki) seems to be the best solution to begin. There are a lot of docs written by users and a lot of videos on Youtube. But be sure the content match with your Betaflight's firmware version.

## 4. My flightcontroller is not seen by Betaflight configurator (Windows)

Most of time, there is a problem with the drivers. Be sure to install and use the latest versions :
